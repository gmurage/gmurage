## Introduction
😁 Greetings, my name is Gladys Murage a PHD Data Science student at National University, San Diego, California. USA. 
I am trained to code using Python, R, My SQL workbench, and KNIME.
I enjoy using Python and R for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Predictive Modeling.
I have used KNIME workflow for Inferential and Predictive Analysis.
I have completed learning Databases and Business Intelligence using My SQL Workbench.
I enjoy Predictive Modeling with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithims
I have expertise in creating regresion models, classification, clustering and ensemble algorithms.
I am an expert at looking for uncovered insights in data, and communicating findings to various stakeholders in a clear none jargon communication style.
I graduate with my Data Science PHD in 2027. I just finsihed my second year this spring and love being a data scientist.
