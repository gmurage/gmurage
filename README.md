## Machine Learning & Data Science
### Evaluate and Contrast the Classification Techniques
#### Heart Disease Prediction — Summary

- Dataset: 303 patient records; 13 clinical features; binary classification task.

- Tools and libraries: Implemented in Python using scikit-learn.

- Models compared: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

- Workflow: Data preprocessing, cross‑validated training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with standard performance metrics.

- Top result: Logistic Regression achieved the best performance (85.7% accuracy), strongest generalization, and the most favorable bias‑variance tradeoff.

- Model strengths: Logistic Regression — interpretable and computationally efficient for structured, linearly separable data.

- Random Forest findings: Identified feature importance (chest pain type strongest predictor); showed overfitting tendencies and required careful tuning to control variance.

- k-NN findings: Underperformed; sensitive to feature representation and scales poorly in higher dimensions.

##### Practical guidance:

- Use Logistic Regression for small-to-medium, structured, interpretable problems.

- Use Random Forest for larger, complex datasets with careful tuning.

- Use k-NN only for small, low-dimensional problems with rigorous preprocessing.

##### Conclusion
Algorithm choice should balance accuracy, interpretability, computational cost, and dataset characteristics to match research objectives.
